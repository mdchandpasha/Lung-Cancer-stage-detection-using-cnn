**Overview**
Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes by enabling timely treatment. Advances in medical imaging and image processing have led to the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, which are vital tools that help radiologists detect and diagnose lung cancer early.

**Project Description**
This project focuses on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop a lung cancer stage detection system. The system analyzes CT scan images to predict whether they show normal, beginning, or malignant stages, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning. We utilized technologies such as Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to build this system.

**Technologies Used**
